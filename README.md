# JSON parser

This is an Java API for loading/parsing JSON.

## How to use

Before parsing JSON you should check if it is an array or an object (this only refers to the outermost and any other gets detected automatically).

### Parsing a JSON object

Call the factory method `fromString(String string)` from class `JSONObject`. The `string` variable should be your JSON object as a String.
Done.

### Parsing a JSON array

Call the factory method `fromString(String string)` from class `JSONArray`. The `string` variable should be your JSON array as a String.
Done.
